# Multi-Agent Handoff

## Building a handoff

```bash
codemap handoff .                 # Build + save full artifact
codemap handoff --json .          # Machine-readable for other tools
codemap handoff --prefix .        # Stable context only (hubs, configured file count)
codemap handoff --delta .         # Recent work only (changed files, risk, events)
```

## What's in a handoff

- **Prefix** (stable): configured project file count, hub summaries — changes rarely
- **Delta** (dynamic): changed files, risk files, recent edit events, next steps
- **Hashes**: deterministic hashes for cache validation across agents

## Consuming a handoff

```bash
codemap handoff --latest .        # Read most recent saved artifact
codemap handoff --detail file.go . # Lazy-load full context for one file
```

The MCP tool `get_handoff` provides the same capabilities for tool-based consumption.
The prefix file count and size-based handoff budgets honor the active
`.codemap/config.json` filters even when watch state tracks a broader working set.

## When to handoff

- Switching from Claude to Codex (or vice versa)
- Starting a new Claude session on the same branch
- Context window getting full — compact and resume
- Passing work to a teammate's AI session
