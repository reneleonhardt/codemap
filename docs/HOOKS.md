# Codemap Hooks

Hooks give Claude Code and Codex automatic codebase context throughout a session or task.

## The Full Experience

| When | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| **Session starts** | Claude sees full project tree, hubs, branch diff, and last session context |
| **After compact** | Claude sees the tree again (context restored) |
| **You mention a file** | Claude gets intent analysis, hub context, risk level, working set, and suggestions |
| **Before editing** | Claude sees who imports the file AND what hubs it imports |
| **After editing** | Claude sees the impact of what was just changed |
| **Before memory clears** | Hub state is saved so Claude remembers what's important |
| **Session ends** | Timeline of all edits + saves layered handoff artifacts for next agent/session |

## Quick Setup

Recommended (project-local hooks + config):

```bash
# install codemap (no repo clone needed)
brew tap JordanCoin/tap && brew install codemap

cd /path/to/your/project
codemap setup
```

Global settings instead of project-local:

```bash
codemap setup --global
```

This command:
- creates `.codemap/config.json` when missing
- merges codemap hooks into Claude and Codex settings without removing existing hooks
- keeps hook setup idempotent (safe to run more than once)

Use `--agent claude` or `--agent codex` to configure only one integration.
Managed commands use the verified absolute path of the running `codemap`; rerun
setup if that path changes. `codemap doctor` validates without rewriting.

Important: run `codemap setup` from the git repo root. Hook commands run relative to the current working directory; starting Claude from a nested folder can prevent codemap from finding `.git` and `.codemap`.

### Manual Hook JSON (advanced)

If you want to manage Claude settings manually, add this `hooks` object to `.claude/settings.local.json` (or `~/.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "codemap hook session-start"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "codemap hook pre-edit"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "codemap hook post-edit"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "codemap hook prompt-submit"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PreCompact": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "codemap hook pre-compact"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "SessionEnd": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "codemap hook session-stop"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Code. You should immediately see project context at session start.

If you intentionally run Claude from subdirectories, pass the repo root explicitly:

```bash
codemap hook session-start "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
```

---

## Project Config

Hooks automatically respect `.codemap/config.json` when present. This lets you filter what Claude sees at session start without replacing the hook command.

```bash
codemap config init    # Auto-detect top extensions and create config
codemap config show    # View current config
```

Example `.codemap/config.json`:
```json
{
  "only": ["rs", "sh", "sql", "toml", "yml"],
  "exclude": ["docs/reference", "docs/research"],
  "depth": 4,
  "mode": "auto",
  "budgets": {
    "session_start_bytes": 30000,
    "diff_bytes": 15000,
    "max_hubs": 8
  },
  "routing": {
    "retrieval": { "strategy": "keyword", "top_k": 3 },
    "subsystems": [
      {
        "id": "watching",
        "paths": ["watch/**"],
        "keywords": ["hook", "daemon", "events"],
        "docs": ["docs/HOOKS.md"],
        "agents": ["codemap-hook-triage"],
        "instructions": "This subsystem manages file watching. Check daemon state before modifying events."
      }
    ]
  },
  "drift": {
    "enabled": true,
    "recent_commits": 10,
    "require_docs_for": ["watching"]
  }
}
```

All fields are optional. When set:
- `only` — session-start tree shows only files with these extensions
- `exclude` — hides matching paths from the tree
- `depth` — overrides the adaptive depth calculation
- `mode` — optional hook orchestration hint (`auto`, `structured`, `ad-hoc`)
- `budgets` — optional hook budgets (`session_start_bytes`, `diff_bytes`, `max_hubs`)
- `routing` — prompt-submit routing hints (keyword `strategy`, `top_k`, subsystem definitions)
  - `subsystems[].instructions` — markdown instructions injected when this subsystem matches (e.g., domain-specific guidance for Claude)
- `drift` — documentation drift detection
  - `enabled` — when true, prompt-submit checks if docs are stale relative to code changes
  - `recent_commits` — how far back to look in git history (default: 10)
  - `require_docs_for` — subsystem IDs whose documentation freshness should be checked

CLI flags (`--only`, `--exclude`, `--depth`) always override config values. The bare `codemap` command also respects this config.

## What Claude Sees

### At Session Start (and after compact)
```
📍 Project Context:

╭────────────────────────────── myproject ──────────────────────────────╮
│ Files: 85 | Size: 1.2MB                                               │
│ Top Extensions: .go (25), .yml (22), .md (10), .sh (8)                │
╰───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
myproject
├── cmd/
│   └── hooks      hooks_test
├── render/
│   └── colors     depgraph   skyline    tree
├── scanner/
│   └── astgrep    deps       filegraph  types      walker
└── main.go        go.mod     README.md

⚠️  High-impact files (hubs):
   ⚠️  HUB FILE: scanner/types.go (imported by 10 files)
   ⚠️  HUB FILE: scanner/walker.go (imported by 8 files)

📝 Changes on branch 'feature-x' vs main:
   M scanner/types.go (+15, -3)
   A cmd/new_feature.go

🕐 Last session worked on:
   • scanner/types.go (write)
   • main.go (write)
   • cmd/hooks.go (create)
```

### Before/After Editing a File
```
📍 File: cmd/hooks.go
   Imported by 1 file(s): main.go
   Imports 16 hub(s): scanner/types.go, scanner/walker.go, watch/daemon.go...
```

Or if it's a hub:
```
⚠️  HUB FILE: scanner/types.go
   Imported by 10 files - changes have wide impact!

   Dependents:
   • main.go
   • mcp/main.go
   • watch/watch.go
   ... and 7 more
```

### When You Mention a File (Prompt Submit)

The prompt-submit hook now performs **intent classification** — it analyzes what you're trying to do and surfaces relevant code intelligence.

```
<!-- codemap:intent {"category":"refactor","confidence":1,"risk":"high",...} -->

📍 Context for mentioned files:
   ⚠️  scanner/types.go is a HUB (imported by 10 files)

💡 Suggestions (risk: high):
   • [review-hub] scanner/types.go — hub file imported by 10 files — changes have wide impact
   • [check-deps] scanner/types.go — verify dependents still compile after changes
   • [run-tests] . — run full test suite after refactoring

<!-- codemap:routes [{"id":"scanning","score":3,"docs":["docs/MCP.md"]}] -->

📚 Suggested context routes:
   • scanning (score=3) docs=docs/MCP.md

🔧 Working set: 3 files (1 hubs)
   • scanner/types.go (5 edits, +15 lines ⚠️HUB)
   • cmd/hooks.go (3 edits, +42 lines)

📊 Session so far: 5 files edited, 2 hub edits
```

**Structured markers** (`<!-- codemap:intent -->`, `<!-- codemap:routes -->`) are machine-readable JSON that tools can parse. The human-readable output is always shown alongside them.

#### Intent Categories

| Category | Triggered By | Extra Context |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| `refactor` | refactor, rename, move, extract, split | Dependency checks, full test suite |
| `bugfix` | fix, bug, broken, error, crash | Test suggestions for affected package |
| `feature` | add, implement, create, new, build | Hub impact if touching hub files |
| `explore` | how does, where is, what uses | Subsystem routing suggestions |
| `test` | test, coverage, spec, benchmark | - |
| `docs` | document, readme, changelog | Drift warnings if enabled |

#### Risk Levels

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `low` | No hub files involved |
| `medium` | 1 hub file in scope |
| `high` | 2+ hub files, or a hub with 8+ importers |

#### Working Set

The **working set** tracks files you've edited during the current session. It shows edit count, net line delta, and hub status — giving Claude awareness of your active work context.

### At Session End
```
📊 Session Summary
==================

Edit Timeline:
  14:23:15 WRITE  scanner/types.go +15 ⚠️HUB
  14:25:42 WRITE  main.go +3
  14:30:11 CREATE cmd/new_feature.go +45

Stats: 8 events, 3 files touched, +63 lines, 1 hub edits
🤝 Saved handoff to .codemap/handoff.latest.json
```

### Next Session Start (Handoff Resume)
If a recent handoff exists **for the current branch**, session start includes a compact resume block:
```
🤝 Recent handoff:
   Branch: feature-x
   Base ref: main
   Changed files: 6
   Top changes:
   • cmd/hooks.go
   • mcp/main.go
   Risk files:
   ⚠️  scanner/types.go (10 importers)
```

## Available Hooks

| Command | Claude Event | What It Shows |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| `codemap hook session-start` | `SessionStart` | Full tree, hubs, branch diff, last session context |
| `codemap hook pre-edit` | `PreToolUse` (Edit\|Write) | Who imports file + what hubs it imports |
| `codemap hook post-edit` | `PostToolUse` (Edit\|Write) | Impact of changes (same as pre-edit) |
| `codemap hook prompt-submit` | `UserPromptSubmit` | Intent classification, hub context, risk analysis, working set, route suggestions, drift warnings |
| `codemap hook pre-compact` | `PreCompact` | Saves hub state to .codemap/hubs.txt |
| `codemap hook session-stop` | `SessionEnd` | Edit timeline + writes `.codemap/handoff.latest.json`, `.codemap/handoff.prefix.json`, `.codemap/handoff.delta.json` |

---

## Handoff Command

Use handoff directly when switching between agents:

```bash
codemap handoff .             # build + save handoff
codemap handoff --latest .    # read latest saved handoff
codemap handoff --json .      # JSON payload for tooling
codemap handoff --prefix .    # stable prefix layer only
codemap handoff --delta .     # dynamic delta layer only
codemap handoff --detail a.go . # lazy-load full detail for one changed file
```

---

## Why This Matters

**Hub files** are imported by 3+ other files. When Claude edits them:
- More code paths are affected
- Bugs ripple further
- Tests may break in unexpected places

With these hooks, Claude:
1. **Knows** which files are hubs before touching them
2. **Sees** the blast radius after making changes
3. **Remembers** important files even after context compaction

---

## Prerequisites

```bash
# macOS/Linux
brew tap JordanCoin/tap && brew install codemap

# Windows
scoop bucket add codemap https://github.com/JordanCoin/scoop-codemap
scoop install codemap

# Go
go install github.com/JordanCoin/codemap@latest
```

## Performance

### Startup Latency

Session-start hook performance depends on whether the daemon is running:

| State | Latency | What Happens |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| Daemon running, state fresh | <100ms | Reads `.codemap/state.json` from disk |
| Daemon running, state stale (>30s) | <100ms | Still reads state (daemon is alive) |
| No daemon, small repo (<2000 files) | 200-500ms | Starts daemon + initial scan + dep graph |
| No daemon, medium repo (2000-5000) | 500ms-2s | Starts daemon + scan (deps computed) |
| No daemon, large repo (>5000 files) | 500ms-1s | Starts daemon + scan (deps skipped) |

The daemon is started automatically on session-start and persists across prompts. Subsequent hooks read from the cached state file, so only the first hook invocation pays the startup cost.

### Context Budget

Hooks are budgeted to avoid context blowup:

| Hook | Typical Size | Cap |
|------|-------------|-----|
| session-start | 4-8KB | 60KB hard cap |
| prompt-submit | 180-350 bytes | Skill bodies not injected (pull-based) |
| pre/post-edit | 0-500 bytes | Only for files with importers |
| session-stop | 500-2KB | Last 10 events |
| multi-repo | Varies | 60KB total across all repos |

The 8-second hook timeout prevents any single hook from blocking Claude.

## Verify It Works

1. Run `codemap setup` in your project
2. For Codex, trust project hooks from `/hooks` in CLI or Settings > Hooks in Desktop
3. Start a new Claude Code or Codex session/task
4. You should see project structure at the top
5. Ask the agent to edit a core file - watch for hub warnings
6. End your session and see the summary
